<p class="solid"><strong>Chord Organ Volunteer Singers / Musicians</strong><br>
<a style="color: blue"><strong>Posted 24-March-15</strong></a><br>
Our Parish Priest, Fr Mick Peters, is trying to development and foster a community for our 6 PM Vigil Mass at St Josephs on the Strand. <br>
I'm helping by organising an event format, where I invite our members to bring a plate for a buffet and I provide music, or friends who can sing or perform.<br>
Now that we are achieving some success, we need more people who can sing or play music.<br>
I'm open to any kind of singing or performing so long as it is not too controversial. My preference would be for an artist to sing a medley of old time favorites. <br>
Mass starts at 6pm and finishes about 10 to 7. <br>
If you would like to take part, please call Merle Trembath 0418882633 anytime<br>
